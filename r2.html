            Q1.] Given the Wikipedia definitions on data versus information, what is your own take on this, and specifically describe in your own words what is the difference between data and information?
        <p>
               <h5> I'd say that data is analyzed and reviewed whereas information is the stuff before that. (PLACEHOLDER)
               </h5>
            </p>
        <p>
            Q2.] From the Manovich reading, what is the difference between visualization and mapping?
        </p>
        <h5> Visualization typically is just a picture of an idea whereas mapping require direction of data. (PLACEHOLDER)</h5>
        <p>
            Q3.] When Manovich states that visualization is the anti-sublime art what is he referring to? Do you agree with this notion?
        </p>
        <h5> When Manovich states that "visualization is the anti-sublime art, he is referring to the way in which... (PLACEHOLDER)</h5>
        <p>
            Q4.] Choose two artists, 1 from group A and 1 from group B, then Watch their videos, check their portfolio, and then write a paragraph summarizing each artist, what they showed in their presentation, and the type of art they make.
        </p>
        <h5> From Group A, I decided to watch Stephanie Posavec's presentation where she describes... </h5>
        <p>
            Q5.] Present each artist then tag them with their appropriate tags. Make sure to note who presented who.
        </p>
        <h5>Kim watched Laurie Frick's and Jennifer Daniels's presentations of their respective works. Nicholas watched Aaron Koblin and Jer Thorp's presentations.</h5>
        <p>
            Q6.] Create one more aesthetic catagory (tag) that is not in the list above, that might be another way of characteriing their work. It should have to do with them being an artist working with data. Then describe the artists who have this traits and the ones from your list that do not. For each catagory you describe you should be able find more than one artist that has this trait, but not all of them. In addition, For each each artist that fits this catagory, give a brief explanation with examples from their work.
        </p>
        <h5> If I had to come up with an additional aesthetic category to group these artists, I'd maybe note some as "Recognizing Data Patterns"</h5>
