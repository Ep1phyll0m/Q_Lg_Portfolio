<h1> Exercise 2 </h1>

<p>  In this sketch, I decided to lean into the Minecraft theme. </p>
<p>
    Hold the mouse button around and move it around to see the first text. Press any button while simultaneously clicking and moving the mouse to get the second set of text moving in the opposite direction. <br>    
            
            I was able to input my horse images fairly easily, but it took me a while to figure out why I was being met with a black. After returning back to the code a day later, I found that I hadn't fully replaced all the initial identified terms with my own. Once I fixed that, however, I was able to get the program running. <br>
            To add to the Minecraft theme, I tried to make a vague representation of a grass block texture, so I played around with the same rectangle function that were interspersed between the other horse images albeit a bit smaller and green to imitate a grass block.  <br>
