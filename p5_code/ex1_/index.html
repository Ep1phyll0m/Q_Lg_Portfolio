<h2> Exercise 1 </h2>

<p> 
    This exercise was all about combining several  different examples together. <br>
    I used a few if-else statements and played with the variables depending on the movement of the mouse in relation to the canvas. I also added an arc and an additional quad function for more drawing elements. I tried to make the former look a bit like pacman due to its familiar shape.

 </p>
 
 
 <p>    
            This sketch's interactivity is dependent on one's initial mouse movement within the canvas, though when left inside, the shapes due tend to "twist" from time to time.
            Assigning the variables at which there would be changes and the colors themselves was probably most fun when adjusting the sketch <br>
            Challenges that arose when coding this sketch was trying to organize which variables were used and figuring out how to make the shapes look more dynamic, whether through shape or color throughout the setting. <br>
